				<p class="p1">A Resident Welfare Association (frequently abbreviated as RWA)
				is a civic body that represents the interests of the residents of
				a specific urban or suburban locality in Indian cities.
				Membership is voluntary, and the leadership is usually elected by
				fee-paying members. Members who do not pay the voluntary subsrcription
				fee in any year may not vote in the general body and other meetings of 
				the association since they would be deemed as having opted out of the 
				membership of the voluntary association. In some localities such
				association bear the word 'Development" in their nomenclature such 
				as development and welfare association.
				
RWAs are not official organs of government, and even slums and illegal 
housing localities in India can form RWAs to represent citizen interests.
RWAs are typically registered through co-operative societies acts, which 
require groups to have a minimum of fifteen members from a given area. 
These acts also set the rules for the establishment of RWA bye-laws, which 
include such things as membership criteria, voting rights, and the conditions
under which RWA officers can initiate legal proceeding on behalf of the registered 
society.
Despite the prevalence of RWAs in slums and unauthorized colonies, however,
government programs aimed at involving RWAs in strategic governance decisions,
such as Delhi's Bhagidari Scheme, include only RWAs based in planned neighborhoods.
RWAs have become increasingly involved in municipal politics and decision-making since 
the early 2000s and continue to grow in importance

				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="p1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

					It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
